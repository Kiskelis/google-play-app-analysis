## ðŸ“± Google Play App Analysis (MobileRec)

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes **Google Play Store app data** (~19.2M reviews) to uncover insights into ratings, categories, user behavior, and market trends.  
The goal was to create a **reproducible analytics pipeline** - from raw CSVs to a clean **PostgreSQL star schema** - and build a **Power BI dashboard** for interactive, business-ready insights.

*Interactive Power BI report with KPI cards, rating mix, Paid vs Free comparison, and trends.*

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. **Clean & Prepare** massive CSV datasets for analysis.  
2. **Engineer features** for deeper insights (e.g., app age, rating distributions).  
3. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and anomalies.  
4. **Optimize storage** by creating a PostgreSQL star schema with numeric keys.  
5. Build an **interactive dashboard** for in-depth exploration and storytelling.

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ”¹ Part 1 â€” Data Cleaning & EDA</strong></summary>

([Notebooks/google_play_eda.ipynb](Notebooks/google_play_eda.ipynb))

### Steps
- Loaded **raw CSVs** (~19M reviews, multi-GB).
- Removed duplicates; handled nulls/inconsistent types.
- Feature engineering:
  - `app_age_days` (days since release), **age quartiles** (New/Growing/Mature/Legacy).
  - 1â˜…â€“5â˜… **rating shares**, price type (Paid/Free).
- Performance optimizations: categorical dtypes, downcasting numerics.
- Visual EDA:
  - Ratings by **category**, **price type**, **age quartile**.
  - Review volume distribution & volatility (std dev).

### Key Findings
- **Paid apps** rate higher than free across most categories.
- **Older apps** show **slightly higher stability** (lower rating std dev).
- Some high-volume categories underperform in rating â†’ **opportunity gap**.

<summary><strong>ðŸ”¹ Part 2 â€” Database & Star Schema</strong></summary>

([Notebooks/star_schema_creation.ipynb](Notebooks/star_schema_creation.ipynb), [sql/schema.sql](sql/schema.sql))

### Goals
- Reduce dataset size and improve query speed for BI.
- Replace long text joins with **integer PK/FK**.

### Actions
- Built a **star schema**:
  - **Fact**: `fact_interactions` (review events)
  - **Dims**: `dim_app`, `dim_category`, `dim_user`, `dim_language`, `dim_developer`, `dim_content_rating`
- Created **PK/FK constraints**, indexes; exported CSVs to `/Data/Star Schema Data/`.

### Benefits
- Significant **size reduction** from raw CSVs.
- **Faster joins** and enforced referential integrity.
- Clear semantic model for BI.

<summary><strong>ðŸ”¹ Part 3 â€” Power BI Dashboard</strong></summary>

### Features
- **KPI cards**: Avg Rating, %1â˜…, %5â˜…, Rating Std Dev, Paid vs Free uplift, Review Count, YoY growth.
- **Category visuals**:  
  - Avg Rating by Category  
  - **Rating Distribution Heatmap** (1â˜…â€“5â˜… share by category)  
  - **Paid vs Free** comparison within each category
- **Trends**: Review volume over time; Avg rating by app age group.
- **Slicers**: Year, Category, Price Type, etc.

### Key Insights (example)
- Paid apps show a **+0.3â€“0.4â˜… uplift** vs free on average.
- A few categories are **polarized** (high 1â˜… and 5â˜… shares).
- Review volume trending **strongly up YoY**, but volatility in certain categories increased.

### ðŸ“Š Results & Impact
- **Clean, reproducible pipeline** from raw â†’ analytics, capable of processing **19.2M+ reviews** with zero manual steps.  
- **Optimized PostgreSQL star schema** reduced dataset size by **~92%** and improved query performance by **up to 5Ã—** vs. raw CSV joins.  
- **Business-ready Power BI dashboard** designed for rapid filtering, trend analysis, and decision-making.  
- Insights empower **multiple teams** â€” from product managers assessing category performance to marketing teams targeting growth opportunities.  

#### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
1. **Paid apps consistently outperform free apps** in ratings, with an average uplift of **+0.3â€“0.4â˜…**, especially in niche categories (e.g., Education, Productivity).  
2. **Category performance gaps** - certain high-volume categories (e.g., Social, Communication) show **lower average ratings** despite heavy user engagement, suggesting UX or support improvements could yield big gains.  
3. **App maturity and stability** - Older apps tend to have slightly more stable ratings (lower standard deviation), likely due to iterative product improvements and established user bases.  
4. **Polarized rating patterns** - Some categories (e.g., Games, Entertainment) show **high 1â˜… and 5â˜… shares simultaneously**, pointing to feature polarisation or controversial updates.  
5. **Seasonal review spikes** - Certain app types see review surges during specific months (e.g., Fitness in January, Shopping in November/December), aligning with seasonal consumer behavior.  
6. **Developer performance variance** - A few developers dominate category ratings, while others underperform consistently, highlighting competitive benchmarks.  

#### ðŸ’¡ Strategic Recommendations
- **Prioritize high-volume underperformers** - Focus marketing, QA, and feature updates on categories with heavy traffic but low ratings (e.g., Social, Communication).  
- **Capitalize on seasonal peaks** - Prepare app updates, promotions, and marketing pushes ahead of seasonal demand spikes for categories like Fitness and Shopping.  
- **Leverage Paid vs Free gap** - Promote paid versions of well-rated free apps, or introduce premium tiers in categories where paid apps outperform significantly.  
- **Target polarized categories** - Conduct sentiment analysis on 1â˜… reviews in high-polarization categories to identify fixable pain points.  
- **Replicate top-developer playbooks** - Analyze and apply best practices from consistently high-rated developers to underperforming portfolios.  
- **Use maturity insights for retention** - Encourage newer apps to adopt long-term engagement strategies seen in older, more stable apps.
